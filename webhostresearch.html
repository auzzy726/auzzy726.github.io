<h2>Top Host</h2>
    <p>If I had to choose a host site to go with, I would go with GoDaddy. Even though it is the most expensive, odds are you'll get what you paid for. It also gives you more service options than the other two. I'm not a fan of AWS because the prices are not fixed. You don't really know how much you're going to pay at the end of each billing period because it is based off of usage. As for HostGator, there aren't many selections for the plans. You basically only get three options. They might be good deals, but once again, it's probably a "get what you pay for" situation again. I also crossed multiple reviews from this site, and they are mostly negative. GoDaddy has it's faults too, don't get me wrong. Comparing every factor bewteen the three, GoDaddy pretty much takes the win.</p>
