Spring
</h1>

<p>
Spring is a very beloved time of the year for most people. The harsh cold of the Winter months is finally on its way out (slowly but surely), the birds are on their way out, and the trees and flowers are starting to bud out their beautiful flowers. Who could hate spring?! Plenty to do:

<h2>Fishing</h2>

<p>With the ice on the lakes and creeks melting away, it makes for some great early fly fishing for the year. The rivers and creeks around Montana are abound with all types of fish. Some of the most popular include trout, pike, smallmouth bass, whitefish, suckers, and walleye.</p>

<h2>Go Hiking/Biking</h2>

<p>This time of year, the weather is staying at a pretty cool temperature which is perfect weather for a good outdoor workout. No matter where you live, you are sure to have plenty of trails around to get a nice cardio session in. Before the weather gets too hot, make sure to get back in shape early so you aren't dying of heat stroke by starting in June!</p>
        
<h1>Plant Some Plants/Fruit/Vegetables</h1>
<img src="download-7.jpg">
<p>One of the most favorite hobbies of Americans is growing and nourishing plants, vegetables, and fruits. This can be very entertaining for someone who loves to take care of things but is also extremely time-consuming. Someone needs to be around them at least once or twice everyday to help water them so they can thrive.</p>
