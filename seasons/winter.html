<p>
Winter can either be people's favorite or lease favorite season out of them all. Even if you hate it, you cannot argue against the fact that the snow is a beautiful gift from the skies. There are plenty of opportunities, however, to take advantage of the few months of this weather that we receive. Some of these activities include:

<p>It doesn't matter how old you are, everyone has an immature side that never leaves them. Building a snow fort and pelting each other with snowballs is an activity that you can take part in for hours and will never get old.</p>

<h2>Sledding</h2>

<p>Anyone who's anyone remembers how much fun it was when the snow hit as a kid. You'd rush down to the steepest hill outside of town and take runs down it all day long. You can still have just as much fun at any age, even without your parents nagging you about safety and wearing helmets and all sorts of protective gear!</p>
        
<h1>Skiing/Snowboarding</h1>

<p>There arent many things that will give you more of an adrenaline rush that taking a nice run down the slopes. Even though it is expensive sometimes, the price is usually worth it. With different runs available from beginners to experts, everyone is bound to have an amazing time plowing through the powder all day!</p>
