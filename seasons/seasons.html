Welcome to My Seasons Page!
</h1>
<p>
Every season of the year on Earth has something unique and special about it. Winter includes the magic of Christmas, Spring is when the weather begins to heat up (after being sick of the snow for four months... excpet for Montana where it sticks until May!) Summer is full of free time off of classes, hot weather, and doing just about anything outside. And Fall is very beautiful with all the dark colors of leaves and cool weather starting to roll in. Prepare for a website that will give you a great introduction into the four seasons of the year!
