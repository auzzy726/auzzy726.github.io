<p>Here, I will be taking a look at five state websites and grading them from best to worst based on several factors.</p>

<h2>5. Alaska</h2>

<p>I'll start by saying that this website is about as basis as it can get. You can tell that it was developed by an older person because of this. It is also not compatible with mobile devices, and it will not adjust when you shrink the window on a computer. It just cuts off the page more and more the furter you shrink it. The amount of links they have on the bottom of the page, along all the different sections, could overwhelm a user that is unfamiliar with the program. Also, the fact that the color of everything on the page is the same exact shade of blue is kind of a turn off.</p>
<p>On the upside of things, I really don't believe that this page could have been organized any better. Every section of the page is organized into a cleanly-sorted link portion. I am also loving the news section of the home page. Finally, the picture of the mountain range is a very appealing touch to add some beauty to the product.</p>

<h2>4. Montana</h2>

<p>First, I think the colors on the page are too plain. There could be a more attractive blue or green to make it more attractive, but not too excotic at the same time. I also feel like since there's so much information on the home page, most of that information could be on another part of the page, reachable through a link from a drop-down bar. Lastly, the organization of the sections on the home page, to me, are in a weird order. I feel like all the main information about the state such as contact information, facts, maps, and officers should be at the top and less important things like weather and video and photo galleries should come after.</p>
<p>However, one of my favorite parts about this page is the background of the beautiful Rocky Mountains. The page is very clean and appeals to just about everyone. It includes plenty of useful links to other areas that are needed for all Montana citizens such as a voting page, road conditions, driver license renewal, and employment. The state facts and contact information at the bottom of the site is a great touch as well. It might help inform people of what the state is like if they have interest in visiting or moving there.</p>

<h2>3. New Hampshire</h2>

<p>This page has a very unique look to it that none of the other pages contain. I really enjoy the faded state seal behinf the website logo on the top of the page. The main page isn't overcrowded with too much content either. All the information is split up into several different sections of the site. It's very cool that the home page contains the "freguently visited sections" portion of it. This makes the intended location of the site quickly accessible. Once again, I enjoy the "upcoming news and events" section, along with the quick access links at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>The only couple things I was able to sniff out that I wasn't fond of was that the contact information and state facts weren't on the home page. The drop-down sections at the top of the page are also too crowded.</p>

<h2>2. Arizona</h2>
    <img src="download.png">

<p>The creators of this site really have a way with creativity. The picture of the river running under the bridge is a very beautiful image. I think it's cool how the developers gave the users the ability to make font sizes larger or smaller. The site is also split into three different sections in the top right corner, where it allows you to enter into either the service, employee, or agency directory, which I think is an awesome feature. Finally, the way you can get previews at lots of different informative sections that make you dive deep into the facts and activities of the state of Arizona is a phenomonal marketing opportunity that the state did.</p>
<p>My only problem is that the directories are not the most convenient to navigate through to find the group you need.</p>

<h2>1. Nebraska</h2>

<p>This is the best site in my opinion. For one, the background image behind the search box fits the tone of the page. I also really love how they represent some of the statistics of the state in big yellow bubbles. This really grabs the attention of the visitor. The Twitter feed is actually really cool because you can check the updates on the site instead of having to sort through all the people you follow on Twitter just to find the posts from this one page. The navigation bar in the middle of the page can help you with just about anything, from finding a job to courts. The yellow theme of the page fits perfectly. Overall, the page is very clear and easy to sort through to find exaclty what you need. I have nothing bad to say about it at the moment.</p>
