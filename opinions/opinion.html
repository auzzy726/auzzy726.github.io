    <h1>Web Opinions</h1>
    <p>Here, I will be giving reviews on websites, based off of its appearence, accessibility, among other factors, and will classify two of them into the good and one into the bad.</p>
    <h1>The Good</h1>
    <h2>University of Kansas Athletics</h2>

    <p>Now, just because I am a superfan of the Kansas Jayhawks basketball team does not mean this is a biased review! For one, the basic blue color on the drop-down menu and along the side menu gives the website a calm tone. It isn't a bright, blinding color, or a dark, boring shade. The fact that the tabs on the top of the page don't drop down as you hover over them is a very nice touch. This way, if you're busy reading something or looking at anything seriously, it won't get in the way of what you are focusing on by dropping down right in front of your article. I also like how when you hover over an article, the site lets you know by zooming in on the featured picture of the article. The selection of tabs on the top bar is great as well. It ranges from all the sports, to ticket purchases, to a research fund, to Jayhawk aparrel. I love how they show the most trending locations of the site on the left side of the page, making surfing for what you need that much quicker. The  basic "blue and white" design makes it more appealing than making it way too vibrant. Finally, the creators do a great job by putting an "upcoming schedule" section on the bottom left corner of the page, along with ways to follow along.</p>

    <h2>NCAA</h2>

    <p>The top of the page has a nice touch, in the sake that it displays several games in small boxes with the start time of each game, along with a drop down menu next to it to select which sport you want to view games on. Under the drop down bar, there are a few featured news stories, which will keep you interested and allows for the website company to keep you hooked, along with making accessibility ten times simpler. Knowing that most people go to this website to check out the recent "Top 25" rankings for current sports, they have a shortcut along the right side of the page, which is a positive. Towards the bottom of the home page, there are three very popular links, "Road to the Final Four," "Championship Tickets," and "NCAA Shop," which is convenient to NCAA fans. The middle part of the page, however, is too overwhelming with articles. You might be coming here for only one article, and you will be overwhelmed trying to search for a single article in this sea of content. Once again, the "cool blue and white" color scheme, adds a soothing and visitor-friendly atmosphere.</p>

    <h1>The Bad</h1>
    <h2>South Park</h2>
    <img src="Unknown-1%20copy.jpeg">
    <p>My favorite show of all time actually has a pretty disappointing website. To me, the design of the site is too basic. I'm not a person who loves incredibly flashy websites, however, they shouldn't be plain either. For one, the organization of the list of episodes could be a lot better. Right now, they're randomly put in order of the current season, from most recent to furthest back. I believe they should be stacked, in order, from episode number one to the other episodes. The navigation bar on the top of the page is pretty confusing and out of order. In my opinion, you could replace the "blog" and "avatar" tabs with maybe "TV schedule" and "wiki" tabs. The bright yellow color that is used makes the scheme of the website extremely ugly and unappealing. Yellow rarely ever makes a publicly targeted design attractive and enjoyable in the visitors eyes. The way the page changes its scheme from light to dark is kind of annoying. The sudden change, to me, needs to be changed. At least if you want to change the scheme like that, ease it in a litte bit by changing to different shades of grey before going to black.</p>
