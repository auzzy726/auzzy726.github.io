    <h2>Welcome to the Fan Page of the University of Kansas Men's Basketball Team!</h2>
    
    <p>If you're here, CONGRATULATIONS! You have officially chosen the best team in the country (or maybe you're just here for curiosity purposes, but we'll change you to the good side VERY quickly)! Not only has the University of Kansas been led by some of the most successful coaches in basketball history, but the creator of basketball, Dr. James Naismith was the first coach of the program (surprisingly going 55-60). The program came out of the gates with a rocky start. Then Dr. Forrest C. "Phog" Allen arrived. He had the reins for thirty-nine seasons, an all-time high at Kansas, finishing with a 590-219 record, and winning three out of the Jayhawks' five national championships. Because of his success, the basketball arena was named after "Phog" Allen, "Allen Fieldhouse" (nicknamed "The Phog"). The Fieldhouse holds the best home team record, with the Jayhawks only losing a little over 100 games in the building's sixty years. A banner was created by a couple students in the 1990s, "Pay Heed All Who Enter, Beware of the Phog." "Beware of the Phog has become the motto for the Fieldhouse, as it is very intimidating for opposing teams. It basically lets them know that the crowd is as hard to play in as ever, and they will be on top of them, getting in their heads. Hence, the Fieldhouse is viewed as the nation's biggest home court advantage. And, oh yeah, the crowd SHATTERED the "loudest indoor crowd roar" in the Guinness Book of World Records with a deafening, 130.4 decibels. Allen handed the reins off to Dick Harp in 1956, who kept the tradition going, with no problems, taking the Jayhawks to two conference championships and two NCAA Tournament appearences. Moving on to Ted Owens in 1964, he ended his tenure with a 348-128 record, winning six conference titles and made the NCAA Tournament seven times (including a Final Four appearence). In 1983, Larry Brown took over the program. During his six years, Kansas finished either first or second in the conference. He was part of one of the most inspirational tournament runs in basketball history. Entering as a number six seed, the Jayhawks pushed through, upsetting teams left and right, to win the fourth national championship in program history, led by the incredible Danny Manning (getting the nickname "Danny and the Miracles). Every fan knows who Roy Williams is: one of the best college coaches in history and the current coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels. What most people didn't know is he coached for sixteen seasons at Kansas, putting up an .805 winning percentage, reaching the Final Four in four seasons, and losing the national championship in 2003. Now, Bill Self comes into the picture. He was been coaching since 2003, in which he took his team to the Elite Eight round. Putting up a record of 680-212 and 46-19 in postseason tournaments. Overall, here are the all-time program statistics: second in wins with 2,274, third in win percentage with .726, first in regular season conference championships with 61, first in consecutive regular season conference championships with fourteen, tied for seventh in NCAA Tournament titles with three, fifth in title game appearences with nine, fifth in NCAA Final Four appearences with fifteen, third in NCAA Elite Eight appearences with 23, fourth in NCAA Sweet Sixteen appearences with thirty, third in NCAA Tournament appearebces with 48, first in consecutive NCAA Tournament appearences with thirty, second in NCAA Tournament number-one seeds with fourteen, third in NCAA Tournament games played with 155, fourth in NCAA Tournament wins with 107, seventh in NCAA Tournament win percentage with .690, fifth in weeks ranked as AP number-one with 65, second in weeks ranked as AP number-two with 100, fourth in weeks ranked in AP top-five with 347, fourth in weeks ranked in AP top-ten with 540, fourth in weeks ranked in the AP poll with 746, fourth in appearences in final AP poll with 43, third in consecutive weeks ranked in AP poll with 180, third in seasons with 35 wins or more with four, tied for second for seasons with thirty wins or more with 14, third in seasons with 25 wins or more with 32, fifth in seasons with twenty wins or more with 47, first in seasons with a winning record with 97, first in seasons with a non-losing record with 100, first in consecutive seasons with thirty wins with four, first in consecutive seasons with 25 wins with 13, second in consecutive seasons with twenty wins with 29, first in Consensus First Team All-American selections with thirty, first in Consensus First Team All-American players with 23, second in Academic All-American selections with fifteen, and first in Academic All-American players with eleven.</p>
